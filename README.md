How to use:
1- Download this package (d'oh)

2- Go to your Plex Plugins Folder (usualy "PlexInstallFolder/Data/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins", if you changed it then you're probably aware of its path) and extract the folder it contains

3- Remove the "-master" from the folder name, leaving it as "LegendasTV.bundle"

4- On the Plex Manager, set your username and password for Legendas.tv under the agent's settings, enable it and you're done... hopefully
